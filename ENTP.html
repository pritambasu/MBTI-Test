<P>
<p>
As an ENTP, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you
take things in primarily via your intuition.  Your secondary mode is internal,
where you deal with things rationally and logically.
<p>
With Extraverted Intuition dominating their personality, the ENTP's
primary interest in life is understanding the world that they live in.
They are constantly absorbing ideas and images about the situations they
are presented in their lives.  Using their intuition to process this
information, they are usually extremely quick and accurate in their
ability to size up a situation.  With the exception of their ENFP
cousin, the ENTP has a deeper understanding of their environment
than any of the other types.
<p>
This ability to intuitively understand people and situations puts
the ENTP at a distinct advantage in their lives.  They generally
understand things quickly and with great depth.  Accordingly, they
are quite flexible and adapt well to a wide range of tasks.
They are good at most anything that interests them.  As they grow
and further develop their intuitive abilities and insights, they 
become very aware of possibilities, and this makes them quite
resourceful when solving problems.
<p>
ENTPs are idea people.  Their perceptive abilities cause them to
see possibilities everywhere.  They get excited and enthusiastic
about their ideas, and are able to spread their enthusiasm to 
others.  In this way, they get the support that they need to 
fulfill their visions.
<p>
ENTPs are less interested in developing plans of actions or making
decisions than they are in generating possibilities and ideas.
Following through on the implementation of an idea is usually a chore
to the ENTP.  For some ENTPs, this results in the habit of never
finishing what they start.  The ENTP who has not developed their
Thinking process will have problems with jumping enthusiastically
from idea to idea, without following through on their plans.  The
ENTP needs to take care to think through their ideas fully in order
to take advantage of them.
<p>
The ENTP's auxiliary process of Introverted Thinking
drives their decision making process.  Although the ENTP is more
interested in absorbing information than in making decisions,
they are quite rational and logical in reaching conclusions.
When they apply Thinking to their Intuitive perceptions, the
outcome can be very powerful indeed.  A well-developed
ENTP is extremely visionary, inventive, and enterprising.
<p>
ENTPs are fluent conversationalists, mentally quick, and enjoy verbal sparring
with others.  They love to debate issues, and may even switch sides sometimes
just for the love of the debate.  When they express their underlying principles,
however, they may feel awkward and speak abruptly and intensely.
<p>
The ENTP personality type is sometimes referred to the "Lawyer" type.
The ENTP "lawyer" quickly and accurately understands a situation, and 
objectively and logically acts upon the situation.  Their Thinking
side makes their actions and decisions based on an objective list
of rules or laws.  If the ENTP was defending someone who had actually
committed a crime, they are likely to take advantage of quirks in
the law that will get their client off the hook.  If they were to
actually win the case, they would see their actions as completely fair
and proper to the situation, because their actions were lawful.  The
guilt or innocence of their client would not be as relevant.  If this
type of reasoning goes uncompletely unchecked by the ENTP, it could
result in a character that is perceived by others as unethical or
even dishonest.  The ENTP, who does not naturally consider the
more personal or human element in decision making, should take care
to notice the subjective, personal side of situations.  This is
a potential problem are for ENTPs.  Although their logical abilities
lend strength and purpose to the ENTP, they may also isolate them from
their feelings and from other people.
<p>
The least developed area for the ENTP is the Sensing-Feeling arena.  
If the Sensing 
areas are neglected, the ENTP may tend to not take care of details in their
life.  If the Feeling part of themself is neglected, the ENTP may not value
other people's input enough, or may become overly harsh and aggressive.
<p>
Under stress, the ENTP may lose their ability to generate possibilities,
and become obsessed with minor details.  These details may seem to be
extremely important to the ENTP, but in reality are usually not important to
the big picture.
<p>
In general, ENTPs are upbeat visionaries.  They highly value knowledge,
and spend much of their lives seeking a higher understanding.
They live in the world of possibilities,
and become excited about concepts, challenges and difficulties.  When
presented with a problem, they're good at improvising and quickly come
up with a creative solution.  Creative, clever,
curious, and theoretical, ENTPs have a broad range of possibilities in 
their lives.
