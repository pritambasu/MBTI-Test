<P>
As an ISFP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you
deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit
into your value system.  Your secondary mode is external, where you take things
in via your five sense in a literal, concrete fashion.
<p>
ISFPs live in the world of sensation possibilities.  
They are keenly in tune with the way
things look, taste, sound, feel and smell.  They have a strong aesthetic
appreciation for art, and are likely to be artists in some form, because
they are unusually gifted at creating and composing things which will strongly
affect the senses.  They have a strong set of values, which they strive
to consistently meet in their lives.  They need to feel as if they're
living their lives in accordance with what they feel is right, and will
rebel against anything which conflicts with that goal.  They're likely
to choose jobs and careers which allow them the freedom of working towards
the realization of their value-oriented personal goals.
<p>
ISFPs tend to be quiet and reserved, and difficult to get to know well.
They hold back their ideas and opinions except from those who they are
closest to.  They are likely to be kind, gentle and sensitive in their
dealings with others.  They are interested in contributing to people's
sense of well-being and happiness, and will put a great deal of effort and
energy into tasks which they believe in.
<p>
ISFPs have a strong affinity for aesthetics and beauty.  They're likely to be
animal lovers, and to have a true appreciation for the beauties of nature.
They're original and independent, and need to have personal space.
They value people who take the time to understand the ISFP, and who support
the ISFP in pursuing their goals in their own, unique way.  People who
don't know them well may see their unique way of life as a sign of
carefree light-heartedness, but the ISFP actually takes life very seriously,
constantly gathering specific information and shifting it through their
value systems, in search for clarification and underlying meaning.
<p>
ISFPs are action-oriented individuals.  They are "doers", and are 
usually uncomfortable
with theorizing concepts and ideas, unless they see a practical application.
They learn best in a "hands-on"
environment, and consequently may become easily bored with the traditional
teaching methods, which emphasize abstract thinking.  They do not
like impersonal analysis, and are uncomfortable with the idea of making 
decisions based strictly on logic.  Their strong value systems demand that
decisions are evaluated against their subjective beliefs, rather than
against some objective rules or laws.
<p>
ISFPs are extremely perceptive and aware of others.  They constantly gather
specific information about people, and seek to discover what it means.  They
are usually penetratingly accurate in their perceptions of others.  
<p>
ISFPs are warm and sympathetic.  They genuinely care about people, and are
strongly service-oriented in their desire to please.  They have an 
unusually deep well of caring for those who are close to them, and are
likely to show their love through actions, rather than words.
<p>
ISFPs have no desire to lead or control others, just as they have no desire
to be led or controlled by others.  They need space and time alone to 
evaluate the circumstances of their life against their value system,
and are likely to respect other people's needs for the same.
<p>
The ISFP is likely to not give themself enough credit for the things which
they do extremely well.  Their strong value systems can lead them to be
intensely perfectionist, and cause them to judge themselves with
unneccesary harshness.
<p>
The ISFP has many special gifts for the world, especially in the areas
of creating artistic sensation, and selflessly serving others.  Life is
not likely to be extremely easy for the ISFP, because they take life so
seriously, but they have the tools to make their lives and the lives
of those close to them richly rewarding experiences.
