<P>
<p>
As an ESFJ, your primary mode of living is focused externally, where you
deal with things according to how you feel about them, or how they fit
in with your personal value system.  Your secondary mode is internal,
where you take things in via your five senses in a literal, concrete fashion.
<p>
ESFJs are people persons - they love people.  They are warmly interested
in others.  They use their Sensing and Judging characteristics to gather
specific, detailed information about others, and turn this information into 
supportive judgments.  They want to like people, and have a special
skill at bringing out the best in others.  They are extremely good at
reading others, and understanding their point of view.  The ESFJ's strong desire
to be liked and for everything to be pleasant makes them highly supportive
of others.  People like to be around ESFJs,
because the ESFJ has a special gift of invariably making people feel good
about themselves. 
<p>
The ESFJ takes their responsibilities very seriously, and is very dependable.
They value security and stability, and have a strong focus on the
details of life.  They see before others do what needs to be done, and do
whatever it takes to make sure that it gets done.  They enjoy these types of
tasks, and are extremely good at them.
<p>
ESFJs are warm and energetic.  They need approval from others to feel 
good about themselves.  They are hurt by indifference and don't understand 
unkindness.  They are very giving people, who get a lot of their personal
satisfaction from the happiness of others.  They want to be appreciated for
who they are, and what they give.  They're very sensitive to others, and 
freely give practical care.
ESFJs are such caring individuals, that they sometimes have a hard time seeing
or accepting a difficult truth about someone they care about.
<p>
With Extraverted Feeling dominating their personality, ESFJs are focused on
reading other people.  They have a strong need to be liked, and to be in
control.  They are extremely good at reading others, and often change their
own manner to be more pleasing to whoever they're with at the moment.
<p>
The ESFJ's value system is defined externally.  They usually have very
well-formed ideas about the way things should be, and are not shy about 
expressing these opinions.  However, they weigh their values and morals
against the world around them, rather than against an internal value
system.  They may have a strong moral code, but it is defined by the
community that they live in, rather than by any strongly felt internal
values.  
<p>
ESFJs who have had the benefit of being raised and surrounded by a strong
value system that is ethical and centered around genuine goodness will
most likely be the kindest, most generous souls who will gladly give you
the shirt off of their back without a second thought.  For these individuals,
the selfless quality of their personality type  is genuine and pure.  ESFJs
who have not had the advantage of developing their own values by weighing 
them against a good external value system may develop very questionable values.
In such cases, the ESFJ most often genuinely believes in the integrity of
their skewed value system.  They have no internal understanding of values to
set them straight.  In weighing their values against our society, they find
plenty of support for whatever moral transgression they wish to justify.
This type of ESFJ is a dangerous person indeed.  Extraverted Feeling
drives them to control and manipulate, and their lack of Intuition
prevents them from seeing the big picture.  They're usually quite popular
and good with people, and good at manipulating them.  Unlike their ENFJ
cousin, they don't have Intuition to help them understand the real consequences
of their actions.  They are driven to manipulate other to achieve their own
ends, yet they believe that they are following a solid moral code of conduct.
<p>
All ESFJs have a natural tendency to want to control their environment.
Their dominant function demands structure and organization, and seeks closure.
ESFJs are most comfortable with structured environments.  They're not likely
to enjoy having to do things which involve abstract, theoretical concepts, or 
impersonal analysis.  They do enjoy creating order and structure, and are
very good at tasks which require these kinds of skills.  ESFJs should be
careful about controling people in their lives who do not wish to be
controlled.
<p>
ESFJs respect and believe in the laws and rules of authority, and believe
that others should do so as well.  They're traditional, and prefer to do
things in the established way, rather than venturing into unchartered territory.
Their need for security drives their ready acceptance and adherence to the 
policies of the established system.  This tendency may cause them to sometimes
blindly accept rules without questioning or understanding them.
<p>
An ESFJ who has developed in a less than ideal way may be prone to 
being quite insecure, and focus all of their attention on pleasing others.
He or she might also be very controling, or overly sensitive, imagining
bad intentions when there weren't any.
<p>
ESFJs incorporate many of the traits that are associated with women in our
society.  However, male ESFJs will usually not appear feminine at all.
On the contrary, ESFJs are typically quite conscious about gender roles
and will be most comfortable playing a role that suits their gender in 
our society.  Male ESFJs will be quite masculine (albeit sensitive
when you get to know them), and female ESFJs will
be very feminine.  
<p>
ESFJs at their best are warm, sympathetic, helpful, cooperative, tactful,
down-to-earth, practical, thorough, consistent, organized, enthusiastic,
and energetic.  They enjoy tradition and security, and will seek stable
lives that are rich in contact with friends and family.
